This simulations plots the effective potential in a GDScript program.

The Hamiltonian is solved for the two bodies problem, and the resulting integrals are numerically integrated using Runge-Kutta of 4th order.
There are interactive examples and sliders (without boundary conditions, so use at your own risk!) that recalculate the problem for the initial conditions given.

The trajectory is also shown, alongisde a toggleable 1D problem.
